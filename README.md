# Game of Commerce

Game of Commerce takes place in the mythical world of Westeros from the wildly popular book and TV series Game of Thrones. Instead of telling the story of the main actors within Westeros battling it out for control of the Iron Throne, this game focuses instead on how all the machinations and antics of the bigger characters in the story affect the unknown background characters and events -- namely, the price of resources traded across the continent. You are a trader buying and selling resources from ten major cities. The goal is to acquire the highest number of coins you can.

This is a full-stack game that makes use of express.js, mySQL, normalize.css, and Mobile Boilerplate HTML template, among other technologies.
