        <p style='text-align: left'><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> Playing Game of Trades will expose you to many Game of Thrones characters and events. 
            If you haven't seen the show or read the books the show is based on, you probably shouldn't play the game.
            However, you are your own person, and having warned you, The Game of Trades Team will not feel remorse for spoiling anything. Do you understand?</p>
